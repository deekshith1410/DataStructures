1. I will take you through our FSL transformation journey in the next few minutes. 
	Opportunities that we identified and executed to transform this legacy process to make it more agile and efficient.
2. To begin with a short introduction about FSL.  
	it is a Stochastic Gradient Descent-Neural Network model used for representing the likelihood of a charge or txn to be fraud at Point of Sale. 
	This Model updates every week and leverages recent data to reflect changes in fraudster tactics.
	and this model will not be developed from scratch every week, but will refresh the weights or coefficients in the existing model to capture the constantly evolving fraud trends.

talking about high level process flow, the first step is
3. Data Pull - pull all frauds and a sample of good transactions 
	Data QC - we are using DataQC tool which is in python.
	Model is trained with SGD-NN model
	Model QC - PSI/Cohens-D checks are performed
--- This capability is implemented End-To-End in CAS right now from Data creation till Model Deployment. 


(can anyone guess what is wrong in this approach) 
what is wrong with this approach is using CAS as a system for analytical activities like Model Training, evaluation.

CAS being a production system should ideally be used for real-time transaction processing and authorizations and 
should not be used for Model Training or analytical purposes.
And Given that model recalibration which happens every week is an analytical activity and also a batch process, 
CAS is not the ideal platform for end-to-end implementation of this process
so there is an opportunity to reduce the load on CAS by migrating the existing resource intensive process like model build and estimation to our analytical environments.


This is the primary driver for the migration and along with it there are few secondary opportunities as well like
2.Maintenance or making Enhancements is time consuming is CAS as all change requests are treated as production changes and 
is dependent on Tech capacity
3.Retention of Data, Model files and reports is for very short duration    due to space constraints in CAS and even modelers are facing hard-time accessing them.



To address the stated opportunities, we have designed a -POA- solution, where we have used
ML studio which basically resides in GOLD server for designing and developing the Framework, and for transaction data, we have leveraged data from Cornerstone CAS slices.
we have followed a modular approach while building the package, so that any change or enhancement can easily be incorporated.
Processes like Model Training, QC checks are performed automatically in Gold server every week and the required model files will be passed to AMC automatically.
Model implementation decision will be taken on AMC UI by the modelers based on the QC metrics and then AMC will Load the model into downstream production systems.



Talking about the benefits in POA :
This is similar to auto-model refresh capability in terms of design
Execution Time is reduced from 15 hrs to 9 hrs and on the other hand, we are even freeing up 15 hrs of CAS system's capacity.
Though we have developed this framework for FSL, the modules can be easily scalable can be used for similar self learning techniques.
we can also maintain a repository of 12 to 18 months of data and other files in Gold server and can be made available for modellers , as the space here is much cheaper and duly available when compared to CAS.
